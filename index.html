                <p> My name is Derrick Stahlman, and I am excited to share that I have recently graduated from Cleveland Community College. I received an associate of science degree in web development and programming, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer science and development. Through this program, I learned about various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and more. </p>

                <p>

                    During my time at Cleveland Community College, I gained hands-on experience in developing websites and software applications. I was able to apply the concepts I learned in class to real-world projects, which gave me a deeper understanding of the field. Additionally, I had the opportunity to collaborate with other students and work on group projects, which enhanced my communication and teamwork skills.</p>

                    <p>
                    
                    Now that I have completed my studies, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I am confident that my education and experience have prepared me for a successful career in web development and programming. I am excited to see where this career path takes me and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
